### Main (unreleased)

### Changes

- [437](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/437) - Use minimum between per-class `job_iteration_max_job_runtime` and `JobIteration.max_job_runtime`, instead of enforcing only setting decreasing values.
  Because it is possible to change the global or parent values after setting the value on a class, it is not possible to truly enforce the decreasing value constraint. Instead, we now use the minimum between the global value and per-class value. This is considered a non-breaking change, as it should not break any **existing** code, it only removes the constraint on new classes.
- [443](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/443) - Use Sidekiq `:quit` callback to detect graceful shutdown. This makes job-iteration compatible with Sidekiq run in embedded mode.

### Bug fixes

- [437](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/437) - Defer reading `JobIteration.max_job_runtime` until runtime, instead of closing around the value at the time of job definition.
- [431](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/431) - Use `#id_value` instead of `send(:id)`
when generating position for cursor based on `:id` column (Rails 7.1 and above, where composite
primary models are now supported). This ensures we grab the value of the id column, rather than a
potentially composite primary key value.
- [456](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/431) - Use Arel to generate SQL that's type compatible for the
  cursor pagination conditionals in ActiveRecord cursor. Previously, the cursor would coerce numeric ids to a string value 
  (e.g.: `... AND id > '1'`)

## v1.4.1 (Sep 5, 2023)

### Bug fixes

- [427](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/427) - Use the Rails application logger. Changes from [338](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/338) resulted in logging to the original value of ActiveJob.logger, not the one configured by the Rails application.

## v1.4.0 (Aug 23, 2023)

### Changes

- [338](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/338) - All logs are now `ActiveSupport::Notifications` events and logged using `ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber` to allow customization. Events now always include the `cursor_position` tag.
- [418](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/418) - Return `nil` from `Iteration#perform`, to signal not to rely on return value.

### Features

- [240](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/240) - Allow setting inheritable per-job `job_iteration_max_job_runtime`
- [310](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/310) - Support nested iteration
- [341](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/341) - Add `JobIteration.default_retry_backoff`, which sets a default delay when jobs are re-enqueued after being interrupted. Defaults to `nil`, meaning no delay, which matches the current behaviour.
- [365](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/365) - Support composite primary key as a cursor

### Bug fixes

- [289](https://github.com/Shopify/job-iteration/pull/289) - Fix uninitialized constant error when raising `ConditionNotSupportedError` from `ActiveRecordBatchEnumerator`
