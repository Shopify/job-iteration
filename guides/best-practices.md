# Best practices

## Batch iteration

Regardless of the active record enumerator used in the task, `job-iteration` gem loads records in batches of 100 (by default).
The following two tasks produce equivalent database queries,
however `RecordsJob` task allows for more frequent interruptions by doing just one thing in the `each_iteration` method.

```ruby
# bad
class BatchesJob < ApplicationJob
  include JobIteration::Iteration

  def build_enumerator(product_id, cursor:)
    enumerator_builder.active_record_on_batches(
      Comment.where(product_id: product_id),
      cursor: cursor,
      batch_size: 5,
    )
  end

  def each_iteration(batch_of_comments, product_id)
    batch_of_comments.each(&:destroy)
  end
end

# good
class RecordsJob < ApplicationJob
  include JobIteration::Iteration

  def build_enumerator(product_id, cursor:)
    enumerator_builder.active_record_on_records(
      Comment.where(product_id: product_id),
      cursor: cursor,
      batch_size: 5,
    )
  end

  def each_iteration(comment, product_id)
    comment.destroy
  end
end
```

## Instrumentation

Iteration leverages [`ActiveSupport::Notifications`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html)
to notify you what it's doing. You can subscribe to the following events (listed in order of job lifecycle):

- `build_enumerator.iteration`
- `throttled.iteration` (when using ThrottleEnumerator)
- `nil_enumerator.iteration`
- `resumed.iteration`
- `each_iteration.iteration`
- `not_found.iteration`
- `interrupted.iteration`
- `completed.iteration`

All events have tags including the job class name and cursor position, some add the amount of times interrupted and/or
total time the job spent running across interruptions.

```ruby
# config/initializers/instrumentation.rb
ActiveSupport::Notifications.monotonic_subscribe("each_iteration.iteration") do |_, started, finished, _, tags|
  elapsed = finished - started
  StatsD.distribution(
    "iteration.each_iteration",
    elapsed,
    tags: { job_class: tags[:job_class]&.underscore }
  )

  if elapsed >= BackgroundQueue.max_iteration_runtime
    Rails.logger.warn "[Iteration] job_class=#{tags[:job_class]} " \
    "each_iteration runtime exceeded limit of #{BackgroundQueue.max_iteration_runtime}s"
  end
end
```

## Max iteration time

As you may notice in the snippet above, at Shopify we enforce that `each_iteration` does not take longer than `BackgroundQueue.max_iteration_runtime`, which is set to `25` seconds.

We discourage that because jobs with a long `each_iteration` make interruptibility somewhat useless, as the infrastructure will have to wait longer for the job to interrupt.

## Max job runtime

If a job is supposed to have millions of iterations and you expect it to run for hours and days, it's still a good idea to sometimes interrupt the job even if there are no interruption signals coming from deploys or the infrastructure. At Shopify, we interrupt at least every 5 minutes to preserve **worker capacity**.

```ruby
JobIteration.max_job_runtime = 5.minutes # nil by default
```

Use this accessor to tweak how often you'd like the job to interrupt itself.

### Per job max job runtime

For more granular control, `job_iteration_max_job_runtime` can be set **per-job class**. This allows both incremental adoption, as well as using a conservative global setting, and an aggressive setting on a per-job basis.

```ruby
class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  include JobIteration::Iteration

  self.job_iteration_max_job_runtime = 3.minutes

  # ...
```

This setting will be inherited by any child classes, although it can be further overridden. Note that no class can **increase** the `max_job_runtime` it has inherited; it can only be **decreased**. No job can increase its `max_job_runtime` beyond the global limit.
